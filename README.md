##Running with python script

- When running with run.py 
  - please ensure all printf's to the terminal in SCP have been turned off (commented out).
  - you many need to turn off printing the raw output to file (this is broken for some reason when running externally - runs fine when running internally)




Extra python libraries required for run.py
  xlsxwriter
  if not already installed - it can be installed with pip
